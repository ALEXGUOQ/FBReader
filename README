FBReader -- E-book Reader

Latest information you can find at the programs home page at

This file is a quick guide on how to compile the application for Linux desktop.

PLATFORM DESCRIPTION

  The program was originally written for Sharp Zaurus.  However beside two
  different platforms for Zaurus, it can be compiled for linux desktop.

  To compile the program for a particular platform you need to create a file
  called makefiles/target.mk, place there a string like

    TARGET_ARCH = <your target arch>

  The complete list of platforms you can find in makefiles/platforms.mk,
  however currently the program is known to compile without problems on the
  following platforms:

    zaurus-qtopia       -- Sharp Zaurus, Cacko ROM (in fact, any Sharp-based ROM)
    zaurus-pdaxrom-qt   -- Sharp Zaurus, pdaXrom, version >= 1.1.0 RC9, uses qt library
    zaurus-pdaxrom-gtk  -- Sharp Zaurus, pdaXrom, version >= 1.1.0 RC9, uses gtk library
    desktop-qt          -- (linux) desktop computer, uses qt library (version 3.*)
    desktop-gtk         -- (linux) desktop computer, uses gtk library (version 2.*)

  If you do not create makefiles/target.mk file, the program will be built for
  the default platform -- zaurus-qtopia.

REQUIREMENTS

  IMPORTANT: you will need the following libraries:

    expat       -- XML parsing library (available at http://expat.sourceforge.net)
    enca        -- charset detection library (available at http://trific.ath.cx/software/enca/)

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEBIAN

  So if you are a lucky owner of a Debian system and you would like to build
  FBReader for your computer, here are the steps that you need to perform:

  1. You will need QT 3.* installed on your computer:

    $ sudo apt-get install libqt3-mt-dev qt3-dev-tools

  2. Install expat development package:

    $ sudo apt-get install libexpat1-dev

  3. Install enca libraries (bashism!):

    $ pushd /tmp
    $ mkdir enca
    $ cd enca
    $ wget http://www.physics.muni.cz/~yeti/Ftp/enca/i386/libenca0_1.7-1_i386.deb
    $ wget http://www.physics.muni.cz/~yeti/Ftp/enca/i386/libenca-dev_1.7-1_i386.deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i libenca*
    $ cd ..
    $ rm -rf enca
    $ popd

  4. Go to the directory where you unpacked the FBReader sources

  5. Configure sources for Linux Desktop:
    $ echo TARGET_ARCH=desktop-qt > makefiles/target.mk

  6. Build FBReader:

    $ cd zlibrary
    $ make
    $ cd ../fbreader
    $ make
