This file is a quick guide on how to compile the application for Linux desktop.

PLATFORM DESCRIPTION

  The program was originally written for Sharp Zaurus.  However beside two
  different platforms for Zaurus, it can be compiled for linux desktop.

  To compile the program for a particular platform you need to create a file
  called makefiles/target.mk, place there a string like

    TARGET_ARCH = <your target arch>

  The complete list of platforms you can find in makefiles/platforms.mk,
  however currently the program is known to compile without problems on the
  following platforms:

    zaurus-qtopia       -- Sharp Zaurus, Cacko ROM (in fact, any Sharp-based ROM)
    zaurus-pdaxrom-qt   -- Sharp Zaurus, pdaXrom, version >= 1.1.0 RC9, uses qt library
    zaurus-pdaxrom-gtk  -- Sharp Zaurus, pdaXrom, version >= 1.1.0 RC9, uses gtk library
    desktop-qt          -- (linux) desktop computer, uses qt library (version 3.*)
    desktop-gtk         -- (linux) desktop computer, uses gtk library (version 2.*)
    maemo               -- Nokia 770

  If you do not create makefiles/target.mk file, the program will be built for
  the default platform -- zaurus-qtopia.

  This instruction describes how to build the program for desktop-qt and
  desktop-gtk platforms for a Debian system.

REQUIREMENTS

  IMPORTANT: you will need the following libraries:

    expat       -- XML parsing library (available at http://expat.sourceforge.net)
    enca        -- charset detection library (available at http://trific.ath.cx/software/enca/)

  'expat' is a part of Debian archive, so you can install the development
  package for it using the following command:

    $ sudo apt-get install libexpat1-dev

  'enca' is not a part of Debian archive, however there are unofficial Debian
  packages for it. You can install them using the following commands:

    $ mkdir /tmp/enca
    $ cd /tmp/enca
    $ wget http://www.physics.muni.cz/~yeti/Ftp/enca/i386/libenca0_1.7-1_i386.deb
    $ wget http://www.physics.muni.cz/~yeti/Ftp/enca/i386/libenca-dev_1.7-1_i386.deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i libenca*
    $ cd ..
    $ rm -rf /tmp/enca

  Alternatively you can build the packages yourself (sorry, we do not provide
  instructions for it here).

BUILDING FBREADER FOR DESKTOP-QT

  1. You will need QT 3.* installed on your computer:

    $ sudo apt-get install libqt3-mt-dev qt3-dev-tools

  2. Go to the directory where you unpacked the FBReader sources

  3. Configure sources for Linux Desktop:
    $ echo TARGET_ARCH=desktop-qt > makefiles/target.mk

  4. Build FBReader:

    $ make

  At this point you should be able to run FBReader:

    $ cd fbreader
    $ ./FBReader

BUILDING FBREADER FOR DESKTOP-GTK

  1. You will need Gtk+ 2.* installed on your computer:

    $ sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev

  2. Go to the directory where you unpacked the FBReader sources

  3. Configure sources for Linux Desktop:
    $ echo TARGET_ARCH=desktop-gtk > makefiles/target.mk

  4. Build FBReader:

    $ make

  At this point you should be able to run FBReader:

    $ cd fbreader
    $ ./FBReader
