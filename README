This file is a quick guide on how to compile the application.

The program was originally written for Sharp Zaurus.  However beside two
different platforms for Zaurus, it can be compiled for desktop.

To compile the program for a particular platform you need to create a file
called makefiles/target.mk, place there a string like

  TARGET_ARCH = <your target arch>

The complete list of platforms you can find in makefiles/platforms.mk, however
currently the program is know to compile without problems on the following
platforms:

  zaurus-cacko    -- Sharp Zaurus, Cacko ROM
  zaurus-pdaxrom  -- Sharp Zaurus, pdaXrom
  desktop-qt      -- for desktop version of qt

If you do not create makefiles/target.mk file, the program will be built for
the default platform -- zaurus-cacko.

IMPORTANT: you will need the following libraries:

  expat       -- XML parsing library (available at http://expat.sourceforge.net)
  enca        -- charset detection library (available at http://trific.ath.cx/software/enca/)
