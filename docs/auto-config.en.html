  What is automatic configuration file saving and why it's safe

<h3><center>Automatic Configuration File Saving</center></h3>

<h4>Configuration Files</h4>

<p>FBReader distinguishes several categories of configuration data:<ul>
  <li>options that affect application behaviour (places to look for books for, scrolling, keybindings, etc&hellip;)</li>
  <li>options that specifically related to the way how the text is shown</li>
  <li>current state of the program (current and previously read books, positions in each of them)</li>
  <li>information about books, both automatically detected and manually added by the user</li>
</ul></p>

<h4>Automatic Saving</h4>
<p>As of version 0.7.3e FBReader supports automatic configuration data saving: every <i>XX</i>
seconds FBReader tries to save any changed configuration data.  You can control this feature by
opening "Preferences" dialog and going to "Config" page.  There are two options there:<dl>
  <dt>Save State Automatically</dt>
  <dd>controls whether this option is enabled</dd>
  <dt>Timeout between Savings, seconds</dt>
  <dd>controls how often FBReader tries to save the data</dd>
</dl>
