<h2><center>Book Tags in FBReader</center></h2>

<h3>What is a book tag?</h3>
<p>As of version 0.8.16 FBReader supports book tags.  This feature allows for organizing libraries
in a way more convenient for the end user.</p>

<p>A tag is just a text string, set of possible tags is not pre-defined, which means that the user
can add a new tag at any moment.  Each book can have one or more tags.  These tags are listed in the
book information dialog as a list.</p>

<p>For example, if the dialog shows &laquo;Science Fiction, Fantasy, New&raquo;, it means that the
book has three tags &mdash; &laquo;Science Fiction&raquo;, &laquo;Fantasy&raquo; and
&laquo;New&raquo;.</p>

<p>Tag name <b>must</b> not contain a comma symbol (&laquo;,&raquo;).</p>

<p>Spaces and tab symbols at the beginning and the end of a tag name are ignored.</p>

<h3>Hierarchical tags.</h3>
<p>If tag name contains &laquo;/&raquo;, then this tag is considered hierarchical.  For example, tag
list &laquo;Fiction/SF &amp; Fantasy/Fantasy&raquo; will be interpreted as subtag
&laquo;Fantasy&raquo; of subtag &laquo;SF &amp; Fantasy&raquo; of top level tag
&laquo;Fiction&raquo;.</p>
<p>Tag name <b>must</b> not contain a slash symbol (&laquo;/&raquo;).</p>

<h3>Library Tree View.</h3>
<p>Book library is shown as a tree. First levels of the tree are representing book tags (one or
more), next levels are for the book author, for the book series (if present) and the book
title correspondently.</p>

<p>If a book has several tags, it will be available under each tag it has.</p>

<p>If a book has no tags, it will be shown in the branch called &laquo;Books with no tags&raquo;.</p>

<p>Besides, all books can be found in the branch called &laquo;All Books&raquo;.</p>

<h3>Library Tree View Settings.</h3>

<p>If you open the preferences dialog and select &laquo;Library&raquo; tab, you can see two
options:<dl>
    <dt>&laquo;Sort Books by Tags&raquo;</dt>
    <dd>By clearing this option you tell FBReader to show traditional tree with not tags</dd>
    <dt>&laquo;</dt>
    <dd>By clearing this option you tell FBReader to not show the branch called &laquo;All
    Books&raquo;</dd>
</dl>

<!-- p>You can tell FBReader to use traditional tree view with no tags, in order to do so open the
preferences dialog, select &laquo;Library&raquo; tab and clear the checkbox &laquo;Sort Books by
Tags&raquo;.</p>

<p>В том же табе вы можете немного изменить внешний вид дерева, отключив ветку
&laquo;All Books&raquo;.</p -->

<h3>Book Highlighting in the Library View Tree.</h3>
<p>When you open library tree view, the book you are currently reading will be shown and highlighted
in the tree.  While all locations where the book is available are highlighted, you will see the last
appearance of the book in the view.  You can go through all the locations using &laquo;Find
Next&raquo;/&laquo;Find Previous&raquo; buttons.</p>

<h3>How Tags are Defined.</h3>
<p>All tags are defined by the user.  Following sections describe this in more details.  Besides,
certain book formats support tags natively.  As of version 0.8.16, FBReader can extract tags from
books in <code>fb2</code> and <code>oeb/epub</code> formats.</p>

<h3>Settings/Changing Tags for a Book.</h3>
<p>In order to set or to change list of tags for a book, open book information dialog, select
&laquo;Tags&raquo; tab and edit the list.  Tag names will only be changed for the book you update.
If you add a new tag, it will be automatically shown in the tree.  If you delete a tag that only
this book had, the tag will be automatically removed from the tree.</p>

<h3>Changing/Merging/Copying Tags.</h3>
<p>If you would like to change a tag, you can do it in the library tree view: navigate to the tag
you'd like to change and click on the bulb that is to the right to the tag name.</p>

<p>In the opened dialog you can:<ul>
<li>Change the tag name</li>
<p>NB: a tag name <b>must not</b> contain a comma: if you put it there by mistake, the name won't be
changed.</p>
<p>Empty name won't be changed either.</p>
<p>If you use &laquo;/&raquo; in the tag name, it will be considered as a separator for a
hierarchical tag.</p>
<p>Spaces and tab symbols will removed from the beginning and the end of the tag name.</p>

<li>Merge the tag with an existing one</li>
<p>To merge the tag with another one, you just need to change the name of the latter or simply
select it from the list of available tags.</p>

<li>Cloning a tag.</li>
<p>Check the box &laquo;Create clone&raquo; and specify the name of the new tag. If the tag you
specified already exists, the books from with the current tags will be tag with the new tag.</p>

<p>Unlike others, this operation can also be performed for the tags &laquo;All Books&raquo; and
&laquo;Books with no Tags&raquo;.</p>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Deleting Tags.</h3>
<p>If you would like to delete a tag, click on a minus sign right to the tag name.  You will need to
confirm the operation when a dilog appears.  If you confirm the operations, the specified tag will
be removed from all books you have.  <b>Note</b>: no books will be removed by this operation.</p>

<!-- MSS: this is really bad, need a good night sleep :) -->
<p>If the tag you are about to delete has subtags, the confirmation dialog will have three buttons
&mdash; &laquo;This Only&raquo;, &laquo;With Subtags&laquo; and &laquo;Cancel&raquo;.  If you click
on the first one, exactly the selected tag will be removed (if there are any books tagged by it).  If
you click on the second one, then the selected tag and all its subtags will be removed and the
corresponding branch will not be shown in the tree.</p>

<p>For example, if you have books tagged as &laquo;Fiction&raquo; and books tagged as
&laquo;Fiction/Horror&raquo;, and you try to delete tag &laquo;Fiction;&raquo;, you can<ul>
<li>Click on &laquo;This Only&raquo;</li>
<p>In this case, the tag &laquo;Fiction&raquo; will disappear from the tag list of books that were
tagged with it, while tag &laquo;Fiction/Horror&raquo; will remain. And while both tags will be shown
in the library tree view, the first one will have no books.</p>
<li>Click on &laquo;With Subtags&raquo;</li> 
<p>In this case both tags &laquo;Fiction&raquo; and &laquo;Fiction/Horror&raquo; will be removed
from the books that were tagged with them and the whole subtree that started with
&laquo;Fiction&raquo; will not be shown.</p>
