*** Documentation
  ** in 'done' section any feature description should include detailed instruction about how to run it
  ** 'invisible features' (like loading catalog list from the network) are not described in 'done' section
  ** in 'planned' features list 'invisible features are missing too; all the multi-thread related features should be listed separately


*** Code
  ** No C headers in cpp code: newer use <stdio.h>, <cstdio> is much better
  ** And <ZLLogger.h> is much better than <cstdio>
  ** naming convention is broken (class fields with no 'my' prefix, underscores in names)
  ** header style is broken: please separate fields and methods and avoid public (non-const) fields usages (see fbreader/src/network/NetworkLinkCollection.h for an example of bad code)
  ** ZLMimeType::APPLICATION_ATOM_XML_OPDS: ZLMimeType should be converted into a class with name (application/atom+xml) and attribute (profile=opds-catalog), see java code for a sample
  ** ShowNetworkLibraryDisabledAction should be removed; network library should be available everytime; if we cannot show a list of catalogs, waiting message (see ZLDialogManager) should be shown
  ** Please avoid comments like 'qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq'; copyright notices should be added into all the new files
  ** XML parser for OPDS is written twice (OPDSLink::Reader and OPDSLink::GenericReader); this code should be rewritten as we discussed a time ago
  ** network database should be implemented as a separate class, not as a part of BooksDB
